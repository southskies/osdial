	  the outcome. Added a condition for Hangups to mark the man_id as

	  from polluting the queue.
	* [r1541] bin/AST_manager_send.pl: When processing the NEW

	  MonitorConf to a timestamped and lead padded value (It was the
	  filename template for the campaign, which can be non-unique and
	  could cause issue under the right conditions).

	  www/ari/includes/php-asmanager.php, www/index.php: This update
	  contains modifications that allow OSDial to fully support
	  UTF8/Unicode character-sets. Previously, non-latin support
	  existed, but this was both insecure and incomplete. All
	  non-UTF8-safe string manipulation and regular expression
	  functions have been identified and have been replaced with
	  routines that, when UTF8 is in use, will use alternative methods
	  to handle multibyte operations, and when UTF8 is not in use, the
	  routines use the standard non-UTF8-safe functions. There are
	  nearly 500,000 line changes in this revision, the bulk of which
	  is due to rewriting just about every SQL statement so that string
	  fields are properly escaped. Some bugs were discovered and I will
	  touch lightly on them as I summize each section. bin: SQL
	  rewrites and escaping, added TTS generator to osdial_astgen.pl,
	  added fix to OSDcampaign_stats which would cause it to terminate
	  under certain conditions. agi: SQL rewrites and escaping, added
	  routine to IVR which allows for the selection of
	  dynamically-generated-TTS as any selectable
	  announcement/message/playback. extras/sql: Modified existing SQL
	  files so they do not reference a default character-set (ie,
	  Latin1), Added 3 new options to upgrade_sql.pl --use-latin1,
	  --use-utf8, and --convert, when either of the former two options
	  is used with --convert then the entire database is converted to
	  the character-set indicated by --use-latin1 or --use-utf8
	  (warning, going from Latin1 to UTF8 is fine, going the other can
	  cause issues if you have multibyte data in the database.) perl:
	  Added/modified functions having to do with TTS
	  parsing/generation. www: fix include paths. www/ari: fix minor
	  typing bug. www/agent: SQL rewrites and escaping, centralize the
	  character-set identification so that it only occurs once, modify
	  email routine to properly encode UTF8 and UTF8 encoded HTML.
	  www/admin: SQL rewrites and escaping, functionalized auth.php so
	  that it can be called from api.php without needing to perform
	  basic auth, modify all functions to be UTF8 safe, modify email
	  routine here as well in order to properly support UTF8 emails,
	  add functions for listing TTS files/extensions, created new
	  function which displays a list of files and TTS entries for the
	  IVR, add TTS extensions to standard extension list, fixed all
	  permissions checks to use the LOG array provided by the auth
	  function, ensure that script and email templating are UTF8-safe,
	  add character-set option to System Settings...note: it cannot be
	  changed here, agent_stats.pl had a wrong variable for its
	  start_date, reformatted real-time detail so that it would display
	  correctly with both UTF8 and Latin1 character-sets, added
	  list_campaigns and list_usergroups functions to the API, added
	  JSON output mode to API.

	  and whisper together into single scripts...mode is determined by
	  the first digit of the extension. Add blind whisper into

	  flashing graphics. Add section in wrapup completion that clears
	  all of the multical state variables. Add block to in
	  DispoSelect_submit to intercept hangup if a multicall instance is
	  still parked and after the disposition is submitted unpark and
	  load lead instead of resuming agent dialing. Add block in
	  DispoSelect_submit to clear the multicall states if wrapup is not
	  configured. Added functions multicall_answer,

	  multicall_queue_swap.
	* [r1290] www/agent/conf_exten_check.php: Fix variable evaluation
	  as the get_variable function sets the returned variable as blank
	  and not undefined/null. Moved the TimeSync check into

	  so that the parent thread retains the SQL session. Since a new
	  session isn't created with each new processed thread, we can use
	  session bound functions like LOCK and SET. This will eliminate
	  the occasional failure that might occur when an index is
	  recreated and another process writes into the table making it
	  non-unique and causing the index creation to fail.
