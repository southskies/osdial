Installation
-----------------

This tar-ball is specifically created for the generation of RPM packages.
Currently, only RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 and CentOS 5 are supported.


Dialer systems can be very complex, and it is our view that in order to
provide a quality system the installed dialer system must be consistent
and purpose built.  This means that only ISOs are currently available for
fresh installations.
