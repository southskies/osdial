General Information
---------------------

Dialer systems can be very complex, and it is our view that in order to
provide a quality system the installed dialer system must be consistent
and purpose built. This means that only ISOs are the best option for
new installations. While this in an Open Source project, and it is
possible to build the packages from source, it is recommended that
you acquire an ISO or DVD of the precompiled packages for installation.
Our certified installation media provides all of the OSDial dependencies,
pre-compiled, and verified to work flawlessly with the OSDial package.

The DVD is available for download for a reasonable price from http://osdial.com.
The price includes free updates using the Yum package manager until this version
of OSDial reaches End-of-Life.


Installation
-----------------

This tar-ball is specifically created for the generation of RPM packages.
Currently, only RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 and CentOS 6 and other EL6 based
distrobutions are supported. Sorry, there is no support for Debian-based
systems, including Ubuntu.


The easiest route to building the package is to use rpmbuild.

tar xzvf osdial-3.x.tgz
cp ./osdial-3.x/extras/osdial.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
cp ./osdial-3.x.tgz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
cp ./osdial-3.x/extras/osdial-template-example.tgz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/osdial.spec


WARNING: There will be an exhaustive list of unmet RPM dependencies, required
for both building and installing. Most of these are not available through
the mainline distrobution or 3rd-party packagers.
