	* Added "D" option to keepalive options, it uses what would be considered default for that servers profile. Create a server_keepalive_processes table to trake which keepalives are running on which server. The keepalive scripts that can only be run on one server are now aware if the script is running elsewhere, additionally, I have reduced the runtime of each script, so that its load can be more evenly shared across the cluster.

	* This update contains modifications that allow OSDial to fully support UTF8/Unicode character-sets.  Previously, non-latin support existed, but this was both insecure and incomplete.  All non-UTF8-safe string manipulation and regular expression functions have been identified and have been replaced with routines that, when UTF8 is in use, will use alternative methods to handle multibyte operations, and when UTF8 is not in use, the routines use the standard non-UTF8-safe functions.  There are nearly 500,000 line changes in this revision, the bulk of which is due to rewriting just about every SQL statement so that string fields are properly escaped. Some bugs were discovered and I will touch lightly on them as I summize each section.  bin: SQL rewrites and escaping, added TTS generator to osdial_astgen.pl, added fix to OSDcampaign_stats which would cause it to terminate under certain conditions. agi: SQL rewrites and escaping, added routine to IVR which allows for the selection of dynamically-generated-TTS as any selectable announcement/message/playback. extras/sql: Modified existing SQL files so they do not reference a default character-set (ie, Latin1), Added 3 new options to upgrade_sql.pl --use-latin1, --use-utf8, and --convert, when either of the former two options is used with --convert then the entire database is converted to the character-set indicated by --use-latin1 or --use-utf8 (warning, going from Latin1 to UTF8 is fine, going the other can cause issues if you have multibyte data in the database.)  perl: Added/modified functions having to do with TTS parsing/generation. www: fix include paths.  www/ari: fix minor typing bug.  www/agent: SQL rewrites and escaping, centralize the character-set identification so that it only occurs once, modify email routine to properly encode UTF8 and UTF8 encoded HTML. www/admin: SQL rewrites and escaping, functionalized auth.php so that it can be called from api.php without needing to perform basic auth, modify all functions to be UTF8 safe, modify email routine here as well in order to properly support UTF8 emails, add functions for listing TTS files/extensions, created new function which displays a list of files and TTS entries for the IVR, add TTS extensions to standard extension list, fixed all permissions checks to use the LOG array provided by the auth function, ensure that script and email templating are UTF8-safe, add character-set option to System Settings...note: it cannot be changed here, agent_stats.pl had a wrong variable for its start_date, reformatted real-time detail so that it would display correctly with both UTF8 and Latin1 character-sets, added list_campaigns and list_usergroups functions to the API, added JSON output mode to API.

2011-08-16 15:14:08 +0000 Lott Caskey <lottcaskey@gmail.com>
