    <item pathId="dial_method" title="Dial Method">
  This field is the way to define how dialing is to take place. If MANUAL then the auto_dial_level will be locked at 0 unless Dial Method is changed. If RATIO then the normal dialing a number of lines for Active agents. ADAPT_HARD_LIMIT will dial predictively up to the dropped percentage and then not allow aggressive dialing once the drop limit is reached until the percentage goes down again. ADAPT_TAPERED allows for running over the dropped percentage in the first half of the shift -as defined by call_time selected for campaign- and gets more strict as the shift goes on. ADAPT_AVERAGE tries to maintain an average or the dropped percentage not imposing hard limits as aggressively as the other two methods. You cannot change the Auto Dial Level if you are in any of the ADAPT dial methods. Only the Dialer can change the dial level when in predictive dialing mode.
    </item>

    <item pathId="auto_dial_level" title="Auto Dial Level">
  This is where you set how many lines OSDial should use per active agent. zero 0 means auto dialing is off and the agents will click to dial each number. Otherwise OSDial will keep dialing lines equal to active agents multiplied by the dial level to arrive at how many lines this campaign on each server should allow. The ADAPT OVERRIDE checkbox allows you to force a new dial level even though the dial method is in an ADAPT mode. This is useful if there is a dramatic shift in the quality of leads and you want to drastically change the dial_level manually.
    </item>

    <item pathId="available_only_ratio_tally" title="Available Only Tally">
  This field if set to Y will leave out INCALL and QUEUE status agents when calculating the number of calls to dial when not in MANUAL dial mode. Default is N.

    <item pathId="adaptive_maximum_level" title="Maximum Adapt Dial Level">
  This field is where you set the limit of the limit to the numbr of lines you would like dialed per agent while using an adaptive-predictive dial method, not MANUAL or RATIO. This number can be higher than the Auto Dial Level if your hardware will support it. Value must be a positive number greater than one and can have decimal places Default 3.0.
    </item>

    <item pathId="adaptive_latest_server_time" title="Latest Server Time">
  This field is only used by the ADAPT_TAPERED dial method. You should enter in the hour and minute that you will stop calling on this campaign, 2100 would mean that you will stop dialing this campaign at 9PM server time. This allows the Tapered algorithm to decide how aggressively to dial by how long you have until you will be finished calling.
    </item>

    <item pathId="adaptive_intensity" title="Adapt Intensity Modifier">
  This field is used to adjust the predictive intensity either higher or lower. The higher a positive number you select, the greater the dialer will increase the call pacing when it goes up and the slower the dialer will decrease the call pacing when it goes down. The lower the negative number you select here, the slower the dialer will increase the call pacing and the faster the dialer will lower the call pacing when it goes down. Default is 0. This field is not used by the MANUAL or RATIO dial methods.
    </item>

    <item pathId="adaptive_dl_diff_target" title="Dial Level Difference Target">
  This field is used to define whether you want to target having a specific number of agents waiting for calls or calls waiting for agents. For example if you would always like to have on average one agent free to take calls immediately you would set this to -1, if you would like to target always having one call on hold waiting for an agent you would set this to 1. Default is 0. This field is not used by the MANUAL or RATIO dial methods.
    </item>

    <item pathId="concurrent_transfers" title="Concurrent Transfers">
  This setting is used to define the number of calls that can be sent to agents at the same time. It is recommended that this setting is left at AUTO. This field is not used by the MANUAL dial method.
    </item>

  This setting is used to automatically dial alternate number fields while dialing in the RATIO and ADAPT dial methods when there is no contact at the main phone number for a lead, the NA, B, DC and N statuses. This setting is not used by the MANUAL dial method.
    </item>

    <item pathId="next_agent_call" title="Next Agent Call">
  This determines which agent receives the next call that is available:
 &lt;br&gt; - random: orders by the random update value in the osdial_live_agents table
 &lt;br&gt; - oldest_call_start: orders by the last time an agent was sent a call. Results in agents receiving about the same number of calls overall.
 &lt;br&gt; - oldest_call_finish: orders by the last time an agent finished a call. AKA agent waiting longest receives first call.
 &lt;br&gt; - overall_user_level: orders by the user_level of the agent as defined in the osdial_users table a higher user_level will receive more calls.
 &lt;br&gt; - campaign_rank: orders by the rank given to the agent for the campaign. Highest to Lowest.
 &lt;br&gt; - fewest_calls: orders by the number of calls received by an agent for that specific inbound group. Least calls first.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_call_time" title="Campaign Call Time">
  This is where you set during which hours you would like to dial, as determined by the local time in the area &lt;b&gt;where you are calling from&lt;/b&gt;. This is controlled by area code and is adjusted for Daylight Savings time if applicable.  This is essentially an automated on/off switch based on time for the campaign and has no effect on the times you are calling into in various time-zones.
    </item>

    <item pathId="local_call_time" title="Local Call Time">
  This is where you set during which hours you would like to dial, as determined by the local time in the area &lt;b&gt;in which you are calling&lt;/b&gt;. This is controlled by area code and is adjusted for Daylight Savings time if applicable. General Guidelines in the USA for Business to Business is 9am to 5pm and Business to Consumer calls is 9am to 9pm.
    </item>

    <item pathId="dial_timeout" title="Dial Timeout">
  If defined, calls that would normally hang up after the timeout defined in extensions.conf would instead timeout at this amount of seconds if it is less than the extensions.conf timeout. This allows for quickly changing dial timeouts from server to server and limiting the effects to a single campaign. If you are having a lot of Answering Machine or Voicemail calls you may want to try changing this value to between 21-26 and see if results improve.
    </item>

    <item pathId="preview_force_dial_time" title="Preview Force Dial Time">
  If this is set to a number greater than 0, then when in manual-preview dial mode, the call will be placed after the number of seconds set in this field as elapsed with the user needing to click DIAL LEAD.
    </item>

    <item pathId="manualpreview_default" title="Manual Preview Default">
  When set to "Y", and dial method is "MANUAL", preview dialing will be selected by default.
    </item>

    <item pathId="dial_prefix" title="Dial Prefix">
  This field allows for more easily changing a path of dialing to go out through a different method without doing a reload in Asterisk. Default is 9 based upon a 91NXXNXXXXXX in the dial plan - extensions.conf.
    </item>

    <item pathId="omit_phone_code" title="Omit Phone Code">
  This field allows you to leave out the phone_code field while dialing within OSDial. For instance if you are dialing in the UK from the UK you would have 44 in as your phone_code field for all leads, but you just want to dial 10 digits in your dial plan extensions.conf to place calls instead of 44 then 10 digits. Default is N.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_cid" title="Campaign CallerID">
  This field allows for the sending of a custom callerid number on the outbound calls. This is the number that would show up on the callerid of the person you are calling. The default is UNKNOWN. If you are using T1 or E1s to dial out this option is only available if you are using PRIs - ISDN T1s or E1s - that have the custom callerid feature turned on, this will not work with Robbed-bit service -RBS- circuits. This will also work through most VOIP -SIP or IAX trunks- providers that allow dynamic outbound callerID. The custom callerID only applies to calls placed for the OSDial campaign directly, any 3rd party calls or transfers will not send the custom callerID. NOTE: Sometimes putting UNKNOWN or PRIVATE in the field will yield the sending of your default callerID number by your carrier with the calls. You may want to test this and put 0000000000 in the callerid field instead if you do not want to send you CallerID.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_vdad_exten" title="Campaign OSDial extension">
  This field allows for a custom OSDial transfer extension. This allows you to use different VDADtransfer...agi scripts depending upon your campaign. The default transfer AGI - exten 8365 agi-VDADtransfer.agi - just immediately sends the calls on to agents as soon as they are picked up. An additional sample political survey AGI is also now included - 8366 agi-VDADtransferSURVEY.agi - that plays a message to the called person and allows them to make a choice by pressing buttons - effectively pre-screening the lead - . Please note that except for surveys, political calls and charities this form of calling is illegal in the United States.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_rec_exten" title="Campaign Rec extension">
  This field allows for a custom recording extension to be used with OSDial. This allows you to use different extensions depending upon how long you want to allow a maximum recording and what type of codec you want to record in. The default exten is 8309 which if you follow the SCRATCH_INSTALL examples will record in the WAV format for upto one hour. Another option included in the examples is 8310 which will record in GSM format for upto one hour.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_recording" title="Campaign Recording">
  This menu allows you to choose what level of recording is allowed on this campaign. NEVER will disable recording on the client. ONDEMAND is the default and allows the agent to start and stop recording as needed. ALLCALLS will start recording on the client whenever a call is sent to an agent. ALLFORCE will start recording on the client whenever a call is sent to an agent giving the agent no option to stop recording. For ALLCALLS and ALLFORCE there is an option to use the Recording Delay to cut down on very short recordings and recude system load.
    </item>

    <item pathId="campaign_rec_filename" title="Campaign Rec Filename">
  This field allows you to customize the name of the recording when Campaign recording is ONDEMAND or ALLCALLS. The allowed variables are CAMPAIGN CUSTPHONE FULLDATE TINYDATE EPOCH AGENT. The default is FULLDATE_AGENT and would look like this 20051020-103108_6666. Another example is CAMPAIGN_TINYDATE_CUSTPHONE which would look like this TESTCAMP_51020103108_3125551212. 50 char max.

  <section pathId="osdial_list_loader" title="OSDial LIST LOADER FUNCTIONALITY">
    <item pathId="osdial_list_loader" title="OSDial LIST LOADER">
The OSDial basic web-based lead loader is designed simply to take a lead file - up to 8MB in size - that is either tab or pipe delimited and load it into the osdial_list table. The lead loader allows for field choosing and TXT- Plain Text, CSV- Comma Separated Values and XLS- Excel file formats. The lead loader does not do data validation, but it does allow you to check for duplicates in itself, within the campaign or within the entire system. Also, make sure that you have created the list that these leads are to be under so that you can use them. Here is a list of the fields in their proper order for the lead files:
	&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vendor Lead Code - shows up in the Vendor ID field of the GUI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Source Code - internal use only for admins and DBAs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List ID - the list number that these leads will show up under&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phone Code - the prefix for the phone number - 1 for US, 01144 for UK, 01161 for AUS, etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phone Number - must be at least 8 digits long&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title - title of the customer - Mr. Ms. Mrs, etc...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First Name&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Middle Initial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last Name&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address Line 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address Line 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address Line 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;City&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;State - limited to 2 characters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Province&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postal Code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Country&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gender&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Date of Birth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternate Phone Number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email Address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;br&gt;NOTES: The Excel Lead loader functionality is enabled by a series of perl scripts and needs to have a properly configured /etc/osdial.conf file in place on the web server. Also, a couple perl modules must be loaded for it to work as well - OLE-Storage_Lite and Spreadsheet-ParseExcel. You can check for runtime errors in these by looking at your apache error_log file. Also, for duplication checks against gampaign lists, the list that has new leads going into it does need to be created in the system before you start to load the leads.
